Minikube allows us to quicky setup a Kubernetes cluster and test drive Grey Matter before deploying to a production environment. We've provided instructions for two scenarios, [Local Minikube Deployment](#local-minikube-deployment) or [AWS EC2 Deployment](#aws-ec2-deployment).

## Local Minikube Deployment

### Prerequisites

You will need the following tools installed (tested on both Mac OS and Linux Ubuntu):

- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)@1.16.0
- [minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/)@1.4.0
- [helm](https://github.com/helm/helm/releases/tag/v2.16.1)@2.16.1
- [virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)@6.0.12

### Quick Start

A couple of Makefile targets provide a fast and easy way to standup Grey Matter on Minikube.

#### Pre-Requisite

- If you don't have the `envsubst` command you can get it with the `gettext` package on [Mac](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23620827/envsubst-command-not-found-on-mac-os-x-10-8) or Linux. The command is required for using `make credentials`.

Before starting via Minikube you need to supply your credentials for Decipher's Docker registry. These will be your Decipher LDAP credentials: email address and password.

The `fresh` Makefile target runs `make credentials` and `make dev`.

```sh
make fresh
```

You can interactively fillout your credentials with the `credentials` target. This will fillout your docker registry credentials and ask you if you want to setup S3 backing for gm-data. If you chose to have S3 backing you will need to enter a valid access key and secret key.

```sh
make credentials
```

After you have filled out your credentials, you can bring up Minikube and install local Helm charts by running the following:

```sh
make dev
```

You can also install production charts from Decipher's hosted Helm repo by running:

```sh
make prod
```

To spin down minikube.

```sh
make destroy
```

### Start Minikube

To launch a Minikube cluster to a `gm-deploy` VM profile, run the following command:

```sh
minikube start -p gm-deploy --memory 4096 --cpus 4
```

**Note: We specify 4GB of memory and 4 CPUs as this satisfies the minimum resource requirements of Grey Matter.**

You should see a similar output:

```sh
😄  [gm-deploy] minikube v1.3.1 on Ubuntu 18.04
🔥  Creating virtualbox VM (CPUs=4, Memory=4096MB, Disk=20000MB) ...
🐳  Preparing Kubernetes v1.15.2 on Docker 18.09.8 ...
🚜  Pulling images ...
🚀  Launching Kubernetes ...
⌛  Waiting for: apiserver proxy etcd scheduler controller dns
🏄  Done! kubectl is now configured to use "gm-deploy
```

To confirm the status of the Minikube cluster, run the following command:

```sh
minikube status -p gm-deploy
```

You should receive something like the following output:

```sh
host: Running
kubelet: Running
apiserver: Running
kubectl: Correctly Configured: pointing to minikube-vm at 192.168.99.100
```

If you do not then double check that you're using the `-p` flag with the correct profile string.

#### Troubleshooting Minikube start

If you have an older version of Minikube and you receive errors when attempting to start `gm-deploy` then try the below steps.

#### OS X

```sh
rm -rf /usr/local/bin/minikube
rm -rf ~/.minikube
brew update
brew cask reinstall minikube
minikube version
```

## AWS EC2 Deployment

An alternative way to deploy in EC2 is to use the [devinabox](https://github.com/DecipherNow/devinabox) repo which will automate the deployment and configuration of your EC2 instance.

To run the Grey Matter Minikube setup in AWS you will need to spin up a ubuntu18 `t2.xlarge` EC2 instance.

SSH into your EC2 instance:

```sh
ssh -i <path-to-keyfile> ubuntu@<public-dns>
```

Then run the following commands to install dependencies:

```sh

# Install kubectl
sudo apt-get update
curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/v1.15.3/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl
chmod +x ./kubectl
sudo mv ./kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl

# Install Docker
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install docker.io -y
curl -Lo minikube https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/v1.3.1/minikube-linux-amd64 && chmod +x minikube && sudo mv minikube /usr/local/bin/

# Install Helm
curl -LO https://git.io/get_helm.sh
chmod 700 get_helm.sh
./get_helm.sh --version v2.16.1

# add helpful aliases
alias minikube='sudo minikube'
alias helm='sudo helm'
alias kubectl='sudo kubectl'
```

Next, start up Minikube. Note that --vm-driver is set to none because AWS EC2 is a virtual machine. There is no need to install a hypervisor like VirtualBox.

```sh
minikube start --vm-driver=none --memory 4096 --cpus 4 -p gm-deploy
```

We will need `socat` as a dependency of Helm:

```sh
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install socat
```

## Configuration

Our Helm charts can be overridden by custom YAML files that are chained together during install. We've provided two templates:

- [greymatter.yaml](../greymatter.yaml) provides a primary set of overrides
- [greymatter-secrets.yaml](../greymatter-secrets.yaml) provides a separate set of overrides specifically for passwords, secrets, and other sensitive data
  

Copy these files to `custom-greymatter.yaml` and  `custom-greymatter-secrets.yaml`.

### Copy Files to EC2

If deploying to EC2, secure copy these files into the instance.

```sh
scp -i <path-to-keyfile> custom-greymatter-secrets.yaml custom-greymatter.yaml ubuntu@<public-dns>:/home/ubuntu
```

### Docker Credentials

Helm needs valid Docker credentials to pull and run Grey Matter containers. Add your Docker credentials to the `custom-greymatter-secrets.yaml` file. If you need credentials please contact [Grey Matter Support](https://support.deciphernow.com).

```yaml
dockerCredentials:
  registry: docker.production.deciphernow.com
  email:
  username:
  password:
```

## Setup Helm

Before running Helm commands, we need to configure Tiller. This is the Helm server running in the Kubernetes cluster and acts as a endpoint for `helm cli` commands.

```sh
$ helm init
$HELM_HOME has been configured at /home/$USER/.helm.

Tiller (the Helm server-side component) has been installed into your Kubernetes Cluster.

Please note: by default, Tiller is deployed with an insecure 'allow unauthenticated users' policy.
To prevent this, run `helm init` with the --tiller-tls-verify flag.
For more information on securing your installation see: https://docs.helm.sh/using_helm/#securing-your-helm-installation
```

### Configure Voyager Ingress

For Kubernetes, we use the [Voyager Ingress Controller](https://appscode.com/products/voyager/), which automatically provisions a load balancer from a variety of supported cloud providers like EKS in AWS. This allows you to access the cluster at the provided load balancer URL.

At present, there's [an issue](https://github.com/appscode/voyager/issues/1415) specifying Voyager as a dependency so we need to manually configure Voyager ingress as a prerequisite. This can be done with following commands:

```sh
export PROVIDER=minikube
helm repo add appscode https://charts.appscode.com/stable/
helm repo update
helm install appscode/voyager --name voyager-operator --version 10.0.0 \
  --namespace kube-system \
  --set cloudProvider=$PROVIDER \
  --set enableAnalytics=false \
  --set apiserver.enableAdmissionWebhook=false

NOTES:
Set cloudProvider for installing Voyager

To verify that Voyager has started, run:

  kubectl --namespace=kube-system get deployments -l "release=voyager-operator, app=voyager"
```

You should see that the voyager-operator is now running in the namespace `kube-system`.

Note that running `kubectl get ingresses` will not list voyager because it uses its own custom resource definition. Instead, use `kubectl get ingress.voyager.appscode.com --all-namespaces` to find it with kubectl. It may take some time before voyager shows up in the result after the installation, so if you get `No resources found.` response, try again a few minutes later.

Describe ingress is also a useful command for debugging:

```sh
kubectl describe ingress.voyager.appscode.com -n <namespace> <ingress-name>
```

See [Ingress](./Ingress.md) for more details.

## Install

### Latest Helm charts release

To install Helm charts representing the latest version of Grey Matter, you'll need to add the Grey Matter Helm repository to your local `helm` CLI. Run the following command, replacing username/password with credentials previously provided to you. These are the same as your Docker credentials.

```sh
helm repo add decipher https://nexus.production.deciphernow.com/repository/helm-hosted --username <username> --password '<password>'
helm repo update
```

Once the repository has successfully been added to your `helm` CLI, and our environment has been changed to`minikube`, you can install Grey Matter from the latest charts.

**Note: Before installing Helm charts it's always prudent to do a dry-run first to ensure your custom YAML is correct. You can do this by adding the `--dry-run` flag to the below `helm install` command. If you receive no errors then you can confidently drop the `--dry-run` flag.**

```sh
helm install decipher/greymatter -f custom-greymatter.yaml -f custom-greymatter-secrets.yaml --set global.environment=kubernetes --name gm
```

### Local Helm charts

If you are modifying charts or want to run development versions of charts you'll need to clone this repository.

**Note: if you're installing in EC2 you should follow the previous step to install from the hosted Grey Matter Helm repo.**

```sh
git clone git@github.com:DecipherNow/helm-charts.git
```

Then you'll need to modify the repository paths in `requirements.yaml` to point to the relative chart paths of this GitHub project.

```yaml
dependencies:
  - name: dashboard
    version: '2.0.1'
    repository: 'file://../dashboard'
```

Then you can run the following commands to update the local charts and then install them.

```sh
rm -rf greymatter/charts
helm dep up greymatter
helm install greymatter -f custom-greymatter.yaml -f custom-greymatter-secrets.yaml --set global.environment=kubernetes --name gm
```

The `helm dep up greymatter` command will create a `./greymatter/charts` directory with tarballs of each sub-chart that the parent `greymatter` chart will use to install Grey Matter.

### Verification

It may take a few minutes for the installation to become stable. You can watch the status of the pods by running `kubectl get pods -w -n default`. Before attempting to view the Grey Matter dashboard you'll need to setup ingress in the next section.

We also have the option to specify:

- "--replace" will replace an existing deployment
- "--dry-run" will print all Kubernetes configs to stdout

We can run `helm ls` to see all our current deployments and `helm delete --purge $DEPLOYMENT` to delete deployments. If you need to make changes, you can run `helm upgrade gm deciperhnow/greymatter -f custom-greymatter.yaml -f custom-greymatter-secrets.yaml` to update your release in place.

You should also load the appropriate user p12 file according to the certs you configured when deploying Greymatter. The default certs correspond to the quickstart certificates and the `quickstart.p12` file can be found at `certs/quickstart.p12`. You will want to follow your browser specific instructions to load in this user pki. 
[Firefox](https://www.sslsupportdesk.com/how-to-import-a-certificate-into-firefox/) and [Chrome](https://support.globalsign.com/customer/en/portal/articles/1211541-install-client-digital-certificate---windows-using-chrome) instructions.

```sh
NAME                    REVISION        UPDATED                         STATUS          CHART                   APP VERSION     NAMESPACE  
gm                      1               Thu Sep 12 11:25:43 2019        DEPLOYED        greymatter-2.1.0-dev    1.0.2-dev       default
voyager-operator        1               Thu Sep 12 11:19:01 2019        DEPLOYED        voyager-10.0.0          10.0.0          kube-system
```

### Ingress

There are two pods which control our ingress:

- `edge` validates client-facing certificates and gets routing rules from `gm-control-api`.
- `voyager-edge` is our ingress controller. Edge isn't exposed to the outside world, and in a real deployment we need to tie our cluster ingress to an IP address. This points to `edge`.

To hit our cluster, we can access voyager-edge:

```sh
$ minikube -p gm-deploy service --https=true voyager-edge
|-----------|--------------|--------------------------------|
| NAMESPACE   | NAME           | URL                              |
| ----------- | -------------- | -------------------------------- |
| default     | voyager-edge   | http://192.168.99.102:30001      |
|             |                | http://192.168.99.102:30000      |
| ----------- | -------------- | -------------------------------- |
🎉  Opening kubernetes service  default/voyager-edge in default browser...
🎉  Opening kubernetes service  default/voyager-edge in default browser...
```

Change "`http`" of the URL in the console output to "`https`" (i.e. <https://192.168.99.102:30000> in the above example, then navigate to there in your browser.

You should be prompted for your [Decipher localuser certificate](../certs/quickstart.p12) and be taken to the dashboard. Once there, make sure all services are "green" and then pat yourself on the back -- you deployed Grey Matter to Minikube!!

#### EC2

After running the last step where you expose the voyager-edge service, note one of the two ports. We need to expose our instance port to the internet. In your AWS console, navigate to:

EC2 >> (Network & Security) Security Groups >> Your Minikube Security Group >> Inbound

Select the security group you're using and edit the following:

| Parameter      | Value                                                |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Type**       | TCP                                                  |
| **Protocol**   | 30263 (the voyager-edge port from the previous step) |
| **Port Range** | Custom                                               |
| **Source**     | 0.0.0.0/0  (Accessible via the internet)             |

Select **Save**. Navigate back to the AWS instances dashboard and find the `IPv4 Public IP` column. You should be able to see the Grey Matter Dashboard at  `https://<public-ip>:<voyager-edge-port>`.

### Debugging

If you're not prompted for a certificate when navigating to voyager-edge, or you suspect something went wrong with the installation run the following command to see if there were any errors running pods:

```sh
kubectl get events -w | grep error
```

To see the status of Kubernetes configs, you can access the Kubernetes dashboard running within the Minikube cluster with `minikube dashboard`

To debug the mesh, you can access the Envoy admin UI for the edge proxy by running:

```sh
kubectl port-forward $(kubectl get pods --template '{{range .items}}{{.metadata.name}}{{"\n"}}{{end}}' | grep ^edge) 8088:8001
```

Then curl the API to see a list of endpoints you can leverage:

```sh
curl localhost:8088/help
```

For example, if you want to see the status of upstream clusters in the mesh run the following command:

```sh
curl localhost:8088/clusters
```
