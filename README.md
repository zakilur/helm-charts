# Helm Charts for Grey Matter

## Add the Decipher Helm Repo to Helm

You will need to add the Decipher Helm repo to helm running on your machine. Run the following command, replacing the username and password with the Decipher LDAP credentials you've been provided.

```console
helm repo add decipher https://nexus.production.deciphernow.com/repository/helm-hosted --username <ldap username> --password <ldap password>
```

## Prerequisites:

### OpenShift:

- Be able to loginto development environment.
- Run `oc login` this will respnd with something along the lines of

```Login failed (401 Unauthorized)
Verify you have provided correct credentials.
You must obtain an API token by visiting https://development.deciphernow.com:8443/oauth/token/request
```

- Follow the link provided and use the provided comand to login. The command will look something like:
  `oc login --token=<some_crazy_long_and_random_string> --server=https://development.deciphernow.com:8443`

### AWS:

Have an:

- Account access key
- Secret key
- Ability to create a s3 bucket.

### Docker Credentials:

Have:

- Registry OpenShift is configured to pull from
- Account Email
- Account Username/pass

## Deploying charts:

### Install Chart:

To deploy a chart use the helm install command:
`helm install --name <project_name> --namespace <my_namespace> --debug -f custom.yaml <chart_to_deploy>`

- `--debug` prints out the deployment YAML to the terminal
- `--dry-run` w/ debug will print out the deployment YAML without actually deploying to OS/kubernetes env
- `--replace` will create new deployments if they are undefined or replace old ones if they exist
- `-f` allow you to pass in a file with values that can override the chart's defaults. (relative path)

### Dependencies:

If you are deploying a chart like `greymatter` with dependencies defined in `requirements.yaml` you will have an additional step before you can install. You will have to first run `helm dep up greymatter`. This command will create a `charts/` directory with tarballs of the child charts that the parent chart will use. After the charts directory is populated then you will be able to run a `helm install greymatter <options>`

By default the greymatter dependencies will be pulled from a repository as defined in `requirements.yaml`:

```console
dependencies:
- name: dashboard
  version: "1.0.0"
  repository: "https://nexus.production.deciphernow.com/repository/helm-hosted"
```

If you want to make changes to charts you will need to change the requirements.yaml file to point to the appropriate directory:

```console
dependencies:
- name: dashboard
  version: "1.0.0"
  repository: "file://../dashboard"
```

### Deleting install:

To delete a deployment run `helm del --purge <namespace>`. This will delete everything in the deployment. You can use `oc get pods` and `oc get pvc` to check that the rescources in the deployment have been removed (persistent volumes seem to take longer than pods).

### Custom file:

You can override configurations in the `values.yaml` file by including them in the `custom.yaml` file:

```
# What type of enviornment are you deploying Grey Matter into?
#  Valid answers are openshift or kubernetes (all lowercase)
#  Defaults to kubernetes
environment: openshift
domain: development.deciphernow.com
route_url_name: fabric

data:
  data:
    access_key:
    secret_key:
    bucket:
    region:
exhibitor:
  exhibitor:
    access_key:
    secret_key:
    bucket:
    region:

dockerCredentials:
  registry:
  email:
  username:
  password:

jwt:
  jwt:
    secrets:
      - name: jwt-certs
        jwt.cert.pem: |-
        -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
        ...
        -----END CERTIFICATE-----

```

To override values in a particular chart's values.yaml file you will need to include a line in the custom.yaml file similar to the following:

```
<chart_directory>
  <chart name>
      <key_to_override>: <value>
```

## Jenkins pipeline:

- To change the branch jenkins builds from use `./change-build-branch.sh`. The script will ask if you want to change to master, then your current branch, then a manual entry. You must be logged in openshift for this to work.

## Troubleshooting:

- Keep in mind that helm will not teardown any rescources that it did not create in the firstplace. Therefore bestpractice is to manage everything inside a project/namespace with helm or nothing at all.
